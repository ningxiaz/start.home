# House controls

This document should outline the API exposed to the front-end by the Express server. In the interest of time, I think it's important that we focus on implementing the house controls more than any data requests (see data.md for more details on that).

Is it better to use socket.io to control the house? or would a RESTful API be easier to implement and maintain?
